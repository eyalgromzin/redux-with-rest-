## Getting Started

Run the following.

- `git clone https://github.com/meddlin/create-react-app-express.git`
- `cd create-react-app-express/client && yarn`
- `cd ..` 
- `// NOTE: make sure you are back in the root folder`
- `yarn`
- `yarn dev`

## Frontend -- create-react-app

The frontend was created by running `npx create-react-app your-app-name`. There is 
only enough here for a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how to call the 'express' backend.

## Backend -- express web server

Simple 'express' web server with two pre-made routes. Enough is here to demonstrate 
a proof-of-concept for how to respond to requests from the frontend.
